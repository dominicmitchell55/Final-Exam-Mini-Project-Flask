<strong>Overview</strong>

This repository contains the complete implementation of the ISAT 340 Phase III Mini-Project: a fully functional, data-driven web application built using the Flask micro-framework, SQLite, HTML/CSS, and Python.

The project demonstrates full-stack development skills including backend database interactions, dynamic HTML rendering using templates, secure login logic, UI/UX improvements, and deployment-ready organization.

All requirements outlined in the project specification have been implemented. 



<strong>Project Objectives</strong>

Build a dynamic website using Flask and SQLite.

Implement pages to view, update, and display celebrity profile information.

Add a dedicated page to view a single celebrity, including their image and all database fields.

Modify the profile page to display a success notification after form submission.

Improve site security by removing hard-coded credentials and using a database-driven login system.

Enhance UI styling using CSS stored in the /static directory.

Display the correct profile page based on memberID, username, and password.

Organize the codebase properly for GitHub deployment and future hosting on AWS.
